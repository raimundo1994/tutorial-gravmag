## Gravitational and magnetic induction fields produced by rectangular prisms

Algorithms for computing the gravitational and magnetic induction fields
produced by homogeneous rectangular prisms. The formulas are defined in a
local (topocentric) Cartesian coordinate system with axes `x`, `y` and `z`
pointing to north, east and down, respectively.
